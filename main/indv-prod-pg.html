                British producer Ross From Friends aka Felix Clary Weatherall is the newest signing to Flying Lotus’s
                Brainfeeder family. The 24 year old has a fistful of releases under his belt, the distillation of myriad
                influences from hip-hop cut ’n’ paste culture, 80s Eurobeat, Hi-NRG and Italo into lithe, irresistible,
                raw dancefloor trax. He made his debut on Breaker Breaker in 2015, followed by outings on Lobster
                Theremin and sister imprint Distant Hawaii, Lone’s Magicwire and recently: Molten Jets.

                “It’s honestly an absolute rush to sign to Brainfeeder,” he explains. “It has always been pushing such a
                forward thinking sound, one that constantly grabs my attention with every release. I put these 4 tracks
                together with Brainfeeder in mind; I wanted to explore the music that I’ve been developing over the past
                7 years as Ross From Friends whilst trying to explore the explosive sound that the label is best known
                for.”

                Up first, ‘John Cage’ encapsulates both his desire to experiment but also maintain a sense of fun. “It
                originally began life as a tune for this goofy hip-hop project that me and my pal Guy from back home
                always do when he’s in London,” explains Felix. “I’d be making the beat and he raps. It’s always a
                refreshing approach making tracks in that atmosphere because we’re both always on such a spontaneous
                tip. When I’m making music alone, I’m obsessive and everything takes hours, whereas with Guy, we’d try
                and get as many tracks finished as possible in like a few hours. That’s him freestyling a relaxation
                tape in the intro.”</h3>
